- logic
    <!-- - add method to remove clicked cards from play and add three new cards -->
    <!-- - review logic for determining if something is a set or not -->
    <!-- - prevent adding new cards if there are more than twelve cards on the table when a set it made -->
    <!-- - fix the end of the game -->
    - if you click we're stuck and they're aren't any more cards to deal, set game over to true
    - add player names?

- styling
  - buttons so they don't turn blue after click
  - restyle error messages so they aren't so big
